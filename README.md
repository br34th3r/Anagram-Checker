# Anagram Checker

A quick and simple script to check to see if one word is an anagram of another

Just to note, this repo was set up to test compilation to binaries with Python to use in the command line, as such is not fully fleshed out.

## Usage

Either compile to a binary with Cython or some other library or:

```
git clone https://github.com/br34th3r/Anagram-Checker.git
cd Anagram-Checker
python anagram-checker.py <WORD> <WORD>
```
